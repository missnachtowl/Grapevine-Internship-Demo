# Grapevine Categories/Tags Feature
My internship at Grapevine was focused on revamping their existing Categories/Tags feature.

**The existing functionality:**
- Scrollable window
- Selectable categories and tags

**Functionality I was able to implement:**
- Suggested tags populate in a mixed-in fashion based on selected categories
- Searchbar for finding and creating tags
- “Show More” function for suggested tags that responds to category selections/deselections
- Randomized color system
- Counter for user to keep track of selected categories and tags
