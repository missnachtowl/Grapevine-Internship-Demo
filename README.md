A demo of the project I worked on during my summer-long internship with Grapevine. 
<br /><br />
*My internship at Grapevine was focused on revamping their existing Categories/Tags feature.*

## The existing functionality
- Scrollable window
- Selectable categories and tags <br /><br />

<br /><br /><br />


## The functionality I was able to implement:
- [x] Suggested tags populate in a mixed-in fashion based on selected categories
- [x] Searchbar for finding and creating tags
- [x] “Show More” function for suggested tags that responds to category selections/deselections
- [x] Randomized color system
- [x] Counter for user to keep track of selected categories and tags
- [x] Implemented JSON storage for the tags associated to each category 
- [x] Simplified previous code down 300+ lines <br /><br />
