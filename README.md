# Grapevine Categories/Tags Feature
My internship at Grapevine was focused on revamping their existing Categories/Tags feature.

## The existing functionality
- Scrollable window
- Selectable categories and tags

## The functionality I was able to implement:
- [x] Suggested tags populate in a mixed-in fashion based on selected categories
- [x] Searchbar for finding and creating tags
- [x] “Show More” function for suggested tags that responds to category selections/deselections
- [x] Randomized color system
- [x] Counter for user to keep track of selected categories and tags
